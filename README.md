## Hello, my dear reviewer!

1. Please check that 'env' and 'env.local' files are available.
2. Use 'npm install' to add all the modules.
3. After 'npm run dev' you can find current website here - http://localhost:3000 ( That's where it was tested. No static generation, etc...)
4. For sign-in you can use next credentials (mail: test1@mail.com , password: 123456 ) or register by yourself. ( Please be care, there are no validation for both front and back-end. Also UI for the login/register errors isn't provided at the moment)
5. Login state is stored in an atom variable without localstorage, be sure that you're not refreshing the page, otherwise you will be logged out automatically.
6. There are few courses to choose from, but only ('Tailwind CSS From Scratch | Learn By Building Projects') has fulfilled lessons. 
7. Console is showing a plenty of errors, they are coming from embedded YouTube videos. ( I hope so :D )

Thanks, and have a good day!
